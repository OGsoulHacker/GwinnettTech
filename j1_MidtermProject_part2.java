/* Part 2: Account Saving Checking
* A bank in your town updates its customers' accounts at the end of each month.
* The bank offers two types of accounts:
* 		-Savings
* 		-Checking
* Every customer must maintain a minimum balance. If a customer's balance falls 
* below the minimum balance, there is a service charge:
* 		-$10.00 for savings
* 		-$25.00 for Checking accounts
* If the balance at the end of the month is at least the minimum balance, account receives:
* 		( a ) Savings accounts receives 4% interest.
* 		( b ) Checking accounts with balances of up to $5000 more than the minimum balance
* 			  receive 3% interests; otherwise, the interest is 5%.
* Write a program that:
* 	-Reads a customer's ...
* 		- account number ( int type )
* 		- account type ( char type; s/S for savings. c/C for checking)
* 		-minimum balance the account should maintain, and current balance. 
* Program should output
* 		-account number
* 		-account type
* 		-current balance
* 		-new balance
* Test your program by running it five times, using the following data
* 	46728 S 1000 2700
*	87324 C 1500 7689
*	  873 S 1000 800
*	89832 C 2000 3000
*	98322 C 1000 750
