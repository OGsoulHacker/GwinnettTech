/*Part 3: Parking Charges
* A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum parking fee for up to three hours.
* The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part
* thereof in excess of three hours.
* The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
* Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hrs at a time.
* Write an application that calculates parking charges.
* Displays the parking charges for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday.
* You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
* The program should display the charge for the current customer
* should calculate and display the running total of yesterdays's receipts.
