	(Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water 
	from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Program should prompt the user to enter the 
	amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. 
	The formula used to compute the energy is:
	                 Q = M * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) * 4184
	where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperature are in degrees Celsius, 
	and energy Q is measured in joules.
