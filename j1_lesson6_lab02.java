	/* 6.11 (Financial application: compute commissions) Write a method that computes the
	 * commission, using the scheme in programming exercise 5.39. 
	 * 
	 * The header of the method 
	 * is as follows:
	 * public static double computeCommission ( double salesAmount)
	 * 
	 * Write a test program that displays the following table:
               Sales Amount        Commission
               --------------------------------
               10000                 900.0
               15000                1500.0
               ...
               95000               11100.0
               100000              11700.0
               commission = salesAmount * commissionRate;
     *5.39 (Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a sales job
 * in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission. The
 * base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission rate.
 * <p>
 * Sales Amount --------- Commission Rate
 * <p>
 * $0.01�$5,000 --------------- 8 percent
 * <p>
 * $5,000.01�$10,000 ---------- 10 percent
 * <p>
 * $10,000.01 and above ------- 12 percent
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the next
 * $5000 is at 10%, and the rest is at 12%. If the sales amount is:
 *  25,000, the commission is 5,000 * 8% + 5,000 * 10% + 15,000 * 12% = 2,700.
