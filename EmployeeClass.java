/* Write a class named Employee that has the following fields:
        - Name: name field references a String object that holds the employee's name.
        - idNumber: idNumber is an int variable that holds the employee's ID number
        - Department: Department field references a String object that holds the name of the department
                      where the employee works
        - Position: Position field references a String object that holds the employee's job title.

    Employee class should have the following constructors:
        - Constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the
          appropriate fields:
            > employee's name
            > employee's ID number
            > department
            > position

        - Constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the
          appropriate fields:
            > employeeâ€™s name and ID number. accepted as arguments and assigned fields
            > The department fields assigned an empty string ("")
            > position assigned an empty string ("")

        - no-arg constructor that the:
            > assigns empty strings ("") to name,
            > assigns empty strings ("") to department
            > assigns empty strings ("") to position fields
            > assigns 0 to the idNumber field

   Write appropriate mutator methods that store values in these fields and accessor methods that
   return the values in these fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate program
   that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:
   Name          | IDnumber |   Department     |  Position
